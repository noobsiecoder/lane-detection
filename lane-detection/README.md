# Lane Detection using Hough Transform

This project is developed as the final project for the EECE5639 Computer Vision course, Spring 2024, at Northeastern University. The project focuses on detecting lanes in road images and videos using the Hough Transform algorithm. This README provides an overview of the project, its contents, and instructions for usage.

## Overview

Lane detection is a crucial task in computer vision, especially in the domain of autonomous vehicles and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). The Hough Transform is a widely used technique for detecting lines in images. In this project, we implement lane detection using the Hough Transform algorithm in both Python and C++.
